## About our directory

A directory of resources and fundraisers that we think will be helpful to the Palestinians and other victims of Zionism.

## About this directory's admin

I am an undergraduate computer science student in the Americas, and wanted to make this directory as part of my contribution to the Palestinians. I must admit that my understanding of politics, especially Middle Eastern geo-politics, is extremely limited. But nonetheless, I have to take some action to make up for the Palestinian genocide that my country is enabling. 

I cannot direct my own charity efforts because I lack the experience needed to do so, and want to avoid [the social iatrogenics involved with international "voluntourism."](https://www.uvm.edu/~jashman/CDAE195_ESCI375/To%20Hell%20with%20Good%20Intentions.pdf) But hopefully this small contribution of mine can help the Palestinians, even just a little, without a large risk of harm caused by good intentions.
